# Cashcade POS

Cashcade POS is a minimal open-source Point of Sale (POS) system initially developed as a paid product. Due to challenges in the sales department and staffing issues, we decided to discontinue support for the commercial version. After removing any company-specific secrets and design patterns, we've made it available to the community. This project is designed to benefit small businesses by providing a simple and effective POS solution.

## Features
